## What is stacks?

> What is it?

    its a data structure that can be represented as a container which the topmost item is denoted as the top
    When you push something to the stack, it becomes the new top. When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current top and set the next top as top.next

> FILO
> First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

> LIFO
> Last In First Out

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

    its a data structure that can be represented as a container When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

> FILO
