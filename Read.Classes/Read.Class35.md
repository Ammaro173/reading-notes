# Graphs: Introduction

> [Back to Home](../README.md)

Graphs are non-linear data structures made up of two major components:

- `Vertices` – Vertices are entities in a graph. Every vertex has a value associated with it. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the vertices would represent the cities.

- `Edges` – Edges represent the relationship between the vertices in the graph. Edges may or may not have a value associated with them. For example, if we represent a list of cities using a graph, the edges would represent the path between the cities.

- `Neighbor` - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

- `Degree` - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Applications of Graphs

Graphs are used everywhere, from schooling to business. Especially in the fields of computer science, physics, and chemistry.

A few other applications of graphs are:

- To visualize organized data.

- Directed Graphs are used in Google’s Page Ranking Algorithm.

- Social Networks use graphs to represent different users as vertices and edges to represent the connections between them.

- In a mapping application, graphs are used to represent places and the path (distance) between them.

## Types of Graphs

- Graphs Based on Direction
- Graphs Based on Weights
- Special Graphs
